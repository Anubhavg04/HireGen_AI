# 🚀 HireGen AI

HireGen AI is an AI-powered Career Operating System designed to help job seekers convert applications into interviews.

In today's hiring landscape, most resumes get rejected by ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) before a human ever sees them. HireGen AI aims to solve this problem by providing intelligent resume optimization, job-specific customization, and structured application tracking.

## 🎯 Vision

To build a unified AI-driven career toolkit that helps ambitious developers and freshers:

HireGen AI is not just a resume tool — it is being built as a Career OS.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Modern hiring is broken because:

- Generic resumes get auto-rejected
- Candidates don't tailor resumes for specific roles
- No structured application tracking system
- No feedback loop for improvement

HireGen AI addresses these gaps using AI-powered workflows.
